This specification updates <<RFC5545>> by introducing a number of new iCalendar
properties and components which are of particular use for event publishers and
in social networking.

This specification also defines a new STRUCTURED-DATA property for iCalendar
<<RFC5545>> to allow for data that is directly pertinent to an event or task to
be included with the calendar data.
