== Components and properties

Previous extensions to the calendaring standards have been largely restricted to
the addition of properties or parameters. This is partly because iCalendar
libraries had trouble handling components nested deeper than those defined in
<<RFC5545>>.

In a break with this 'tradition' this specification defines a number of
components rather than properties. This is a better match for the way
<<W3C.REC-xml-20081126>> and JSON <<RFC8259>> handle such structures and allows
richer definitions.

It also allows for the addition of extra properties inside the components and
resolves some of the problems of trying to add detailed information as a
parameter.
