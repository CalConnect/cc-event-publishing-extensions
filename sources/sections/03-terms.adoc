== Terms and Definitions

=== Event

When the (perhaps with a capitalised 'E') word 'event' is used we are referring
to gatherings, formal or informal. For example a sports event, a party or a
concert.

=== Social Calendaring

Historically, calendar data and scheduling has been heavily biased towards
meetings in a corporate environment. Some of the features defined in this
document are to support a more informal, i.e. social, model. For example, we may
want to record who is participating in a public event.
